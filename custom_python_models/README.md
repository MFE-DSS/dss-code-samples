# Custom Python Models

This collection of samples serves to integrate additional types of models to the Dataiku Visual ML interface. They are all classifiers or regressors with a `fit` and `predict` method, so they are compatible with the standard `scikit-learn` interface.

Some types of models relying on Python libraries such as LightGBM may require the users to install the library in a code environment.
