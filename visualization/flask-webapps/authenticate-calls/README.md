# Authenticate user on a Flask webapp

In DSS, webapps are accessible by anybody without authentication.

With this code, you can:

* Verify that the browser currently viewing the webapp is authenticated on DSS
* Find out which user is currenty viewing the webapp.

This verification is done in the backend of the webapp (which must be enabled) and is thus safe.
