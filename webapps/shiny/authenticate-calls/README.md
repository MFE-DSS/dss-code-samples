# Authenticate users on a Shiny webapp

In DSS, Shiny webapps are accessible by anybody without authentication.

With this code, you can:
 - Verify that the browser currently viewing the webapp is authenticated on DSS
- Find out which user is currenty viewing the webapp.This verification is done in the backend of the webapp and is thus safe.
