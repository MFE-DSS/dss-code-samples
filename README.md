# DSS code samples
This repository contains various examples of code-based operations for Dataiku DSS.

## Getting started
The examples referenced in this repository take advantage of the [Dataiku DSS public API](https://doc.dataiku.com/dss/latest/publicapi/rest.html), which you can leverage either from inside DSS itself or externally, by following the indications of the [reference documentation](https://doc.dataiku.com/dss/latest/python-api/index.html).
